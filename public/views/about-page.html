  <p class='blurb'> As a Junior, Full-Stack Web Developer I am looking for a challenging project to hone my coding skills and learn from a talented team. I love simple, elegant code that creates well-functioning, user-oriented products with an adaptable, robust backend. I am not afraid of hard work, long hours, or a full-plate of projects. I have a wide range of interests, with a background in genetics research, music production, and over 6 years of Balinese Gamalanâ€”but I love nothing more than coding. </p>
